    <h1>Chapter-46: Events: Button</h1>
<!-- 
    IN the last chapter we learned how to repurpose a link to make
    it trigger an event when it's clicked, instead of loading a new
    page. we learned to do it with inline event-handling, not the best
    way, but the easiest to learn. later in the book , you'll learn the
    approach that's preferred by most professionals-the scipting
    approach.
    But even if we're using the inline method, when we want to give the
    user something to
    click, a more professionals approach , usually, is to use a button
    rather than a link. -->

    <!-- Suppose that when the user click  a button , an alert displays saying, "hello world"
    here's the code.
    <input type="button" value="click" onclick="alert('hello world');">

    button that says hi on click
    <button onclick="alert('hi')">say Hi</button>

    button that calls a function  saying Bye on click
    <button onclick="sayBye()">Say Bye</button>

    button that calls a function  adding two numbers on click
    <button onclick="addFiveAndTen()">Add 5 and 10</button>

    image displaying an alert when clicked
    <img src="./icons/twitterx-logo.png" onclick="alert('twitter has activated')" alt="">

    javascript
    <script>
        function sayBye(){
            alert("Bye");
        }
        function addFiveAndTen() {
            alert(5 + 10);
        }
    </script> -->
